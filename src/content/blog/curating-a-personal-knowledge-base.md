Staying curious is easier when you make discovery, capture, and synthesis a single loop. My flow keeps three stages visible:

1. **Collect sparks.** Short notes, link dumps, sketches. They live in a single inbox.
2. **Promote candidates.** Once a week I surface a handful of sparks, connect them to existing clusters, and decide whether they become long-form notes.
3. **Share downstream.** Finished essays, changelog entries, or workshop outlines link back to the relevant note clusters so the graph keeps growing.

Tools change; the rhythm sticks. The more friction you remove, the more ideas compound.
