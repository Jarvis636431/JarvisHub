Shipping a multi-brand design system sounds elegant until deadlines collide, marketing asks for a new palette, and engineering needs to ship yesterday. Tokens keep everyone honest if you treat them as **human-readable agreements**, not just variables in code.

### Heuristics I keep in rotation

- **Name for intent, not implementation.** `color.accent.surface` stays stable when you tweak hex values and export them out to multiple platforms.
- **Audit weekly.** A ten minute review finds rogue additions before they cascade into long-lived debt.
- **Document decisions.** Designers understand *why* a neutral scale shifted; engineers know when to re-sync.

> Design tokens are only as useful as the conversations they unlock. Keep the language approachable and the loop tight.
