Welcome to the sandbox. This MDX entry mirrors the homepage vision and exercises the **MDX** integration at the same time.

## What to Prototype

- A hero section that combines rich typography with subtle parallax.
- Content collections powering project and writing teasers.
- Progressive enhancement for interactive filters without shipping a framework bundle.

## Lessons Learned

1. Astro Islands let you sprinkle interactivity without turning the entire page into a single app.
2. Using collections keeps content structured, which makes cross-linking between notes, projects, and changelog entries painless.
3. Pairing visuals, copy, and motion early clarifies scope before over-committing to implementation.

> Astro's MDX support makes it easy to mix prose, components, and data-driven snippets while keeping content in the repository.
